# optimistic-future-altar

This is a small, devotional site that may grow!

There are four elements, one in each corner: air, water, fire, and earth. 
In the cardinal directions are four words or phrases.  These can be changed by you based on your need.

Above is the word that drives you, your ideal, the great hope.
Below is the element from which you spring, the root of where you are today.
To the left is the past, the element you are moving away from.
To the right is the future, the element you are moving towards.

The center is a growing list of descriptions for our optimistic future.  It is generated from past visitor's submissions.
If you'd like to add one, click "add!" and enter it in.  I'll review it and add it to the list.
(the review is partly due to my own technical limits, and not knowing how to auto-add to a databse.  But it's also just safety so we don't get a lot of spam.)

Thank you for visiting this site!
